## Required modules

For working you need install "kivy" and "pyperclip". And after you can launch the program.


## Customizing 

If you want to change the font and/or background then replace the files with the corresponding files with the same name("RFont.ttf" for font and "Bg.png" for the background).

### Background Requirements

For the background to be displayed, you need to insert an image with a resolution of 600x200 pixels.
